## My process
1. Planning and Setup
Analyzed the design image provided to understand the layout requirements.
Set up the project directory with necessary HTML and CSS files.

2. Mobile-First Approach
Designed the grid layout with a mobile-first approach.
Created a grid container for the cards using CSS Grid.
Configured the grid to display cards in a single column for mobile devices.

3. Styling the Cards
Styled the individual cards to match the design, including background colors, typography, and spacing.
Used Flexbox properties within each card to structure the elements as per the design.

4. Media Queries
Implemented media queries to adjust the layout for wider screens.
Increased the number of columns in the grid for tablets and desktops.
Modified the styling and layout for larger screens to optimize the user experience.

5. Testing and Debugging
Tested the layout on various devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.
Debugged any layout issues or discrepancies.

6. Final Review
Reviewed the entire project to ensure it matched the design image and met the project goals.
Made any necessary adjustments or refinements.

### What I learned

One of the primary challenges encountered during this project was working with CSS Grid. Although I had some prior knowledge, I had not used grids extensively before. Some specific challenges included:

- Understanding grid container and grid item properties.
- Figuring out how to create complex layouts with varying column and row spans.
- Debugging issues related to grid layout, such as alignment and responsiveness.

This experience highlighted the need for further practice and learning in CSS Grid to become more proficient in using this powerful layout system.

#### SVG Handling

Another challenge I faced during the project was working with SVGs. SVGs are vector graphics that can be used for various purposes, including icons and illustrations. My limited familiarity with SVGs presented the following challenges:

- Integrating SVGs into the project and ensuring they scaled correctly.
- Adjusting SVG colors and styles to match the overall design.
- Optimizing SVGs for performance and accessibility.

While I was able to overcome these challenges with research and experimentation, it became evident that gaining more expertise in SVG manipulation would be beneficial for future projects.



### Continued development

To address these challenges and continue improving my skills in web development, I plan to:

- **Dive Deeper into CSS Grid:** I will dedicate time to learning and practicing CSS Grid layouts extensively, including advanced techniques and best practices. This will enable me to confidently use grids in more complex projects.

- **Expand SVG Knowledge:** I will invest time in expanding my knowledge of SVGs, including techniques for optimizing, styling, and manipulating SVG graphics. This will enhance my ability to work with vector graphics effectively.

- **Ongoing Learning:** Web development is a dynamic field, and I understand the importance of continuous learning. I will stay updated with the latest developments in HTML and CSS to keep my skills current.
